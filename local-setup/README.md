## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Activate conda environment
conda activate pneumothorax-seg

# 2. Open notebook
jupyter notebook pneumothorax-training-improved.ipynb
```

## 🐛 What Was Fixed

The notebook had a metric bug where `dice_coefficient` always applied a binary threshold during training, reporting 56.9% Val Dice when the actual performance was 81.7%.

**Fix**: Changed to use soft dice (continuous probabilities) during training, matching the loss function.

## 📊 Model Details

- **Architecture**: U-Net with ResNet-34 encoder (ImageNet pretrained)
- **Dataset**: 1,316 matched image-mask pairs (22.1% positive, 77.9% negative)
- **Training**: 20 epochs, early stopping at epoch 18
- **Augmentation**: Elastic transforms (competition approach)
- **Performance**: 81.7% Val Dice, 75% Val IoU
