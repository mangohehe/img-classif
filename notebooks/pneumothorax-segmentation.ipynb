The model is implemented in PyTorch.\n","\n","## 1. Introduction\n","\n","Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. U-Net architectures are particularly well-suited for this because they capture both high-level contextual information and fine-grained spatial details. This implementation uses a pre-trained DenseNet121 as the encoder, leveraging transfer learning for improved performance.\n","\n","## 2.
